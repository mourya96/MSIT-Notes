# Declaring an integer variable
int_val = 1 
# Here the int_val stores the value 1 in the memory. Because 1 is an integer, the data type of int_val is integer


# Declaring a float variable
float_val = 1.1 
# Here the float_val stores the value 1.1 in the memory. Because 1.1 is a rational number, the data type of float_val is float


# Declaring a string variable
string_val = 'MSIT'
# Here the string_val stores the value 'MSIT' in the memory. 

# Declaring a boolean variable
bool_val = True 
# The value True is stored in memory with the variable name bool_val.

# Name Error
print(Int_val)
# NameError: name 'Int_val' is not defined. Did you mean: 'int_val'?
# The above comment contains the error message. We know that variable names in python are case sensitive both 'Int_val' and 'int_val' are different
# Since we didn't define Int_val, it gives us the name error.
