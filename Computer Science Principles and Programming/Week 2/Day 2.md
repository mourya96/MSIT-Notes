## Data Representation

### Decimal number system

The numbers we write or read are represented in decimal number system. We have 10 unique digits from 0 to 9 to represent the numbers.

Example:

$$
1980 = 1 \times 10^3 + 9 \times 10^2 + 8 \times 10^1 + 0 \times 10^0
$$

### Binary number system

The way computer reads the data is represented using binary number system. This system has 2 unique digits 0 and 1.

Example:

$$
\begin{align}
   13 &= 1 \times 8 + 1 \times 4 + 0 \times 2 + 1 \times 1 \\
   &= 1 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 \\
   &= 1101 \; \text{in binary}  
\end{align}
$$

Each digit in binary is called a bit.

### Text Representation

As for text the characters are represented using ASCII / Unicode where each character is represented by a number. This number gets converted into binary format for the computer.

Unicode  is generally written as UTF-8 or UTF-16 where the number beside UTF represents the number of bits. So UTF-8 would mean the characters are represented upto the range we can store in 8 bits.

Refer to ASCII (google search) for character representation.
