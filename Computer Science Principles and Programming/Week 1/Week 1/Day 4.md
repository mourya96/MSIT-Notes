## Loops

Loops are a control flow statements that repeat a set of actions multiple times until a certain condition is met.

Example:

- **Do-until**
  - Here **Do** means perform a set of actions and **until** is the condition to be met.
- **Repeat-While**
  - Here **Repeat** would perform set of actions repeatedly **while** the condition is met. If the condition is not met then the loop would stop

The difference between functions and loops is that once a loop finishes executing those set of actions repeatedly, it cannot run again, as in if a loop finishes a task 10 times then we need another loop to execute the task for another 10 times. But that is not the case with functions, we can execute a task/set of tasks any number of times by calling it repeatedly.
