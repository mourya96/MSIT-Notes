# Day 1

Computational Thinking is the template to solve the problems. It is mainly divided into four parts.

- Decomposition
  - Breaking down the problem into smaller parts
- Pattern Recognition
  - Recognizing a pattern occuring in the problem multiple times.
- Abstraction
  - A way of hiding the concrete details or complicated set of instructions/actions by generalizing them into a simplified task.
- Algorithms
  - A step by step process to solve the problem.
