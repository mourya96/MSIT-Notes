## Functions

The different parts of the function are:

1. Name
2. Input
3. Process
4. Output

Example #1: Consider an ice cream machine as a function then:

1. Name -> Ice cream machine
2. Input -> Milk + Sugar + Flavour
3. Process -> Ice cream making process
4. Output -> Ice cream

Example #2: Consider a coffee making machine.

1. Name -> Coffee maker
2. Input -> Espresso maker + milk + hot water
3. Process -> coffee making process
4. Output -> Coffee

Here Espresso maker is another function where it is defined as.

1. Name -> Espresso maker
2. Input -> Coffeemaker + milk
3. Process -> making espresso
4. Output -> Espresso

**Therefore a function is a piece of code or process that can be repeated multiple times with different inputs.**
