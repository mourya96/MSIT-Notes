# The GhostHunters

## Prologue

We (Akhil, Hemanth, and Nagesh) are a group of energetic guys who just graduated and wanted to gain fame and money through social media. So we decided to make an Instagram channel for ghost hunting. One of us found a haunted house in the nearby area which is situated in the outskirts of the city.

## The House

One day, we decided to investigate this haunted house while recording footage to upload it to our channel. On the same night, we reached the area of the haunted house and it was a stormy night. It was raining heavily with thunders while the winds were howling.

One of us started recording the footage and the other started introducing us. After the introduction, we opened the main door which made a loud creaking sound. As soon as we entered the main hall of the house, we heard a loud noise upstairs which sounded like something fragile falling to the floor and breaking it. We got scared but composed ourselves and decided to explore the kitchen area.

## The Kitchen

While exploring the kitchen, we smelled something pungent near the cupboard beside the sink. So we decided to open the cupboard and check any cursed objects or items related to the ghost. It was filled with emptiness except for cobwebs and spiders. Disappointed, we thought there might be a hidden compartment inside it and started hitting it with a stick. As soon as we hit a stick, we heard a hollow sound which implied that there was a compartment inside the fake wall in the cupboard. We broke this fake wall and found a small box.

## The Encounter

This small box was locked with a small lock and tons of paper talismans stuck to this box. The lock had a distinctive symbol drawn on it which looked like a skull and crossbones (something straight out of a pirate logo). We broke the lock and opened the box and found it empty which was disappointing.

One of our friends suggested exploring the upstairs to find more clues about the ghost but as soon as we entered the living room, we found a white foggy figure in the corner and the encounter sent shivers down our spine.

One of us started chanting prayers and the other began recording through the camera. The last one who is out of his mind started making jokes, dismissed them, and started moving towards the ghostly figure. The others got scared pulled him back and ran towards the main door to exit the house.

## Conclusion

As soon as we reached home, we uploaded the footage to our channel. However, we didn't gain any views on our video. So we checked the footage and found no ghost in the video.

The reason, we went to the building with a camera is not only for recording a video but also to keep ourselves safe and sound, because we all know that ***the cameraman never dies***.

## The End
