## Conditionals

Conditionals are constructs that perform different actions/tasks depending on a condition.

Conditionals are where we take the decisions and perform the respective actions.

**If** a condition is satisfied **then** the action is performed.

Example: Traffic lights

- **If** the traffic light is red **then** we stop
- **If** the traffic light is green **then** we move ahead.

$$
\boxed{\text{If} \;\boxed{\text{Decision making Expression}}} \implies \boxed{\text{Then}\; \boxed{\text{Activity/Task}}}
$$

The Decision making expressions are generally **True or False**.

Example:

```python
if (x > 5):
    print(x)
```

Here the decision making expression is `x > 5` and the action is `print(x)`.
So we are printing the value of x if and only if x is greater than 5.
