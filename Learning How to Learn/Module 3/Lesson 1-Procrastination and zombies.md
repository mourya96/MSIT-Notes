## Introduction

Neuroscientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit. So the more we get habituated to our tasks the more we form bigger chunks of information in our brain. Habits are also energy saver for us. It allows us to free our mind for other types of activities. We go into habitual zombie mode for often in these daily tasks.

## Habits

Habits can be divided into four components. They are:

- The cue
  - This is the trigger that launches us into zombie mode. The cues are neither harmless nor harmful. It's the routine, which is the reaction of our brain that affect our actions.
- The routine
  - This is reaction of our brain when we go into zombie mode when we receive the cue. The routines can be harmful or harmless depending on our actions.
- The reward
  - Every habit develops and continues because we get rewarded. The slight and immediate pleasure of completing a task. Procrastination is an easy habit to develop because the reward, which is moving our mind to focus on something pleasing happens so quickly and easily. Finding ways to reward good habits is important for escaping procrastination.
- The belief
  - Habits have power because we have belief in them. To change the habit, we need to change the underlying belief.
