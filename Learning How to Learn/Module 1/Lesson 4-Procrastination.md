# Lesson 4

## Procrastination

When we look at something that we really dont wanna do, we activate some of the areas of the brain that assosciate with pain. Our brain naturally finds ways to stop this negative stimulation by switching our attention to something else. So when try to do something that we dislike we have a bit of unease. To overcome this we funnel our attention into something and turn our attention away from whatever that caused the unease.

- So to overcome this we try to use a technique called pomodoro where we focus our attention on our work for 25 mins.
- Make sure the distractions are turned off.
- Finish the work and get rewarded.
