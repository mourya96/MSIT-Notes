# Lesson 1

## Introduction

So whenever we look at new information, it doesn't make much sense because we haven't pieced the bits of information together. So this is kinda like a jumbled puzzle.

## Chunking

**Chunking** is a mental leap that helps us unite bits of information together through meaning. The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to remember and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into a larget picture of what we are learning. Memorizing a fact without understanding the context doesn't help us understand what's really going on or how the concept fits together with others.

When we are concentrating on something, the four slots of the working memeory which are in the prefrontal cortex of the brain make connections when necessary. It is kinda similar to the octopus of attention that slips it's connection in the working memory and make connections to each other. This is different from the random connections in the diffused mode.

Focusing our attention to tie the bits of information together is the important part of the focused mode of learning which also helps us create chunks of information. This is similar to compressing a folder into a zip file.

When we are stressed, angry or afraid, our brain loses it's ability to make some of the connections. This is one of the reason why we can't recall some of the concepts during exams or interviews even though we have studied or practiced those same concepts.

Basically a chunk means a network of neurons firing together so we can perform an action or think a thought smoothly and effectively. Focused practice and repetition helps us create chunks and strong memory traces. The path to expertise is built by expanding these chunks little by little and all of the expertise serves to underpin more creative interpretations as we gradually become master of the material.

Chunking helps our brain run more efficiently. Once we chunk an information through practice, we dont need to remember all the minor details.

In focused mode of thinking we form smaller chunks and through repetition, these chunks form bigger chunks. Diffused mode of thinking helps us access these chunks more effectively and gain new ideas to solve novel problems.
