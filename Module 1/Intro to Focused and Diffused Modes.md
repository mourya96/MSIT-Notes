# Introduction

Researchers have found that we have two different modes of thinking

- Focused mode
- Diffused mode

Focused mode is when we concentrate intently when we try to understand or learn something.

Diffused thinking is of relaxed thinking which is related to a set of neural resting states.

Here we shall understand these modes of thinking by using pinball game as a metaphor and also an analogy.
