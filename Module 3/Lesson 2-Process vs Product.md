# Lesson 2

## Introduction

- Process mean the flow of time and the habits and actions assosciated with that flow of time. Example: spending 20 mins of time studying a book.
- Product is the outcome of the process. Example: The information gained by spending time studying that book.

To prevent procrastination, we need to focus more on the processes than on the product. Instead our attention should be on building processes.

## Processes

Processes releate to simple habits, habits that coincidentally allows us to do unpleasant tasks that need to be done. One of the easiest way to focus on processes is to use pomodoro. Focusing more on processes allows us to relax and get into flow of work (zombie mode take over) and finish these tasks which we don't like. However, whenever a distraction arises, we need to train ourselves to let it flow by.
